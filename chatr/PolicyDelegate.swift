 This policy delegate class can be initialized and set as the delegate of the IntuneMAMPolicyManager
 (This is done in the AppDelegate.swift file at app initialization)
 Doing this will trigger the wipeDataForAccount and restartApplication methods whenever the Intune SDK needs to do either of these things
 
 NOTE: A number of other methods are avaliable in the IntuneMAMPolicyDelegate. See documentation or header file for more info.
 Methods like identitySwitchRequired and addIdentity are generally used in multi-user apps, unlike this single user app.
